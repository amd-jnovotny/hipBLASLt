*********************************
Building and installing hipBLASLt
*********************************

This document provides all the information required to build and install hipBLASLt on Linux systems.

Prerequisites
=============

To install hipBLASLt, your system must include these components:

*  A ROCm-enabled platform. For more information, see the :doc:`ROCm documentation <rocm:index>`.
*  A compatible version of :doc:`hipBLAS <hipblas:index>`.

Installing prebuilt packages
=============================

Download prebuilt packages from the native package manager for your distribution.
For more information, see the :doc:`ROCm quick-start installation guide <rocm-install-on-linux:install/quick-start>`.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt update && sudo apt install hipblaslt

Building hipBLASLt using the install script
===========================================

You can use ``install.sh`` script to build and install hipBLASLt and its dependencies.
The following sections explain how to use the ``install.sh`` script, including the various script options.

Building the library dependencies and library
---------------------------------------------

The root of the hipBLASLt repository contains the helper bash script ``install.sh`` for building and installing hipBLASLt with a single command.  It takes a lot of options and hard-coded configuration that can be specified through invoking cmake directly, but it's a great way to get started quickly and can serve as an example of how to build/install.
A few commands in the script require ``sudo`` access, so it might prompt you for a password.

Some typical examples showing how to use ``install.sh`` to build the library dependencies and library are
listed in the table below:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Command","Description"
   :widths: 30, 100

   "``./install.sh -h``", "Help information."
   "``./install.sh -d``", "Build the library and dependencies in your local directory. The ``-d`` flag only needs to be used once. For subsequent invocations of ``install.sh``, it's not necessary to rebuild the dependencies."
   "``./install.sh``", "Build the library in your local directory. It is assumed the dependencies are already built."
   "``./install.sh -i``", "Build the library, then build and install the hipBLASLt package in  ``/opt/rocm/hipblaslt``. This prompts you for  ``sudo`` access and installs it for all users. To keep hipBLASLt in your local directory, don't use the flag."

Building the library, client, and all dependencies
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This section explains how to build the library, client, library dependencies, and client dependencies.
The client contains the executables listed in the table below.

============================= ========================================================
Executable Name                Description
============================= ========================================================
``hipblaslt-test``             Runs GoogleTest tests to test the library
``hipblaslt-bench``            Executable to benchmark or test individual functions
============================= ========================================================

Common ways to use ``install.sh`` to build the dependencies, library, and client are
listed in this table.

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Command","Description"
   :widths: 30, 100

   "``./install.sh -h``", "Help information."
   "``./install.sh -dc``", "Build the library dependencies, client dependencies, library, and client in your local directory. The ``-d`` flag only needs to be used once. For subsequent invocations of ``install.sh``, it's not necessary to rebuild the dependencies."
   "``./install.sh -c``", "Build the library and client in your local directory. It is assumed the dependencies are already built."
   "``./install.sh -idc``", "Build the library dependencies, client dependencies, library, and client, then build and install the hipBLASLt package. This prompts you for  ``sudo`` access. To install it for all users,  use the ``-i`` flag. To keep hipBLASLt in your local directory, don't use the flag."
   "``./install.sh -ic``", "Build and install the hipBLASLt package and build the client. This prompts you for ``sudo`` access and installs it for all users. To keep hipBLASLt in your local directory, don`t use the flag."

Static library
----------------

To build static libraries with ``install.sh``, use the ``--static`` option.
This produces a non-standard static library build. This means it has an additional runtime dependency 
consisting of the entire ``hipblaslt/`` subdirectory, which is located in the ``/opt/rocm/lib`` folder. 
You can relocate this folder, but you must set the environment variable ``HIPBLASLT_TENSILE_LIBPATH``
to the new location.

Dependencies
--------------

Dependencies are listed in the ``install.sh`` script. Use ``install.sh`` with the ``-d`` option to install the dependencies.
CMake has a minimum version requirement which is listed in ``install.sh``.
See the ``--cmake_install`` flag in ``install.sh`` to upgrade automatically.

Manual build for all supported platforms
========================================

This section provides information on how to configure CMake and build manually using individual commands.

Building the library manually
----------------------------------------

Before building hipBLASLt manually, ensure the following dependencies are installed on your system:

*  The `hipBLAS-common <https://github.com/ROCm/hipBLAS-common>`_ header files.
*  The `roctracer (roctx) <https://github.com/ROCm/roctracer>`_ library (this is typically pre-installed, but if not, install it).

Building hipBLASLt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To build hipBLASLt, run these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir -p [HIPBLASLT_BUILD_DIR]/release
   cd [HIPBLASLT_BUILD_DIR]/release
   # Default install location is in /opt/rocm, define -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path> to specify other
   # Default build config is 'Release', define -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<config> to specify other
   CXX=/opt/rocm/bin/amdclang++ ccmake [HIPBLASLT_SOURCE]
   make -j$(nproc)
   sudo make install # sudo required if installing into system directory such as /opt/rocm

Building the library, tests, benchmarks, and samples manually
-------------------------------------------------------------

The repository contains source code for clients that serve as samples, tests, and benchmarks.
You can find this code in the ``clients`` subdirectory.

Dependencies for the hipBLASLt clients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The hipBLASLt samples have no external dependencies, but the unit test and benchmarking applications do.
These clients introduce the following dependencies:

- `LAPACK <https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack-release>`_,  which itself add a dependency on a Fortran compiler
- `GoogleTest <https://github.com/google/googletest>`_

Building the hipBLASLt clients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GoogleTest and LAPACK are not easy to install. Many Linux distributions don't provide a GoogleTest package
with precompiled libraries and the LAPACK packages don't have the necessary ``cmake`` configuration files
to allow ``cmake`` to configure the links with the ``cblas`` library. hipBLASLt provides a ``cmake`` script that builds
the above dependencies from source. This is an optional step. You can provide your own builds for
these dependencies and help ``cmake`` find them by setting the ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` definition.
Follow this sequence of steps to build the dependencies and install them to the ``cmake`` default ``/usr/local`` directory.

#. Build the dependencies from source (optional).

   .. code-block:: bash

      mkdir -p [HIPBLASLT_BUILD_DIR]/release/deps
      cd [HIPBLASLT_BUILD_DIR]/release/deps
      ccmake -DBUILD_BOOST=OFF [HIPBLASLT_SOURCE]/deps   # assuming boost is installed through package manager as above
      make -j$(nproc) install

#. After the dependencies are available on the system, configure the clients to build.
   This requires adding a few extra flags to the library ``cmake`` configure script.
   If the dependencies are not installed into the system default directories, like ``/usr/local``,
   pass the ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` to ``cmake`` to help CMake find them.

   .. code-block:: bash

      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<semicolon separated paths>"
      # Default install location is in /opt/rocm, use -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path> to specify other
      CXX=/opt/rocm/bin/amdclang++ ccmake -DBUILD_CLIENTS_TESTS=ON -DBUILD_CLIENTS_BENCHMARKS=ON [HIPBLASLT_SOURCE]
      make -j$(nproc)
      sudo make install   # sudo required if installing into system directory such as /opt/rocm
